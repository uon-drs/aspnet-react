# `.template` directory

This folder contains actual template projects or scripts, not intended for keeping in an actual project, but used to help bootstrap a project.

It should be deleted from project repos once bootstrapping is complete.

Anything outside this folder is intended to be kept in the project repo.

Editing the template repo may require editing the content of this folder as desired :)

# What's here?

- ASP.NET Core backend app template
  - This is the template used to generate an actual Project backend app, to simplify renaming namespaces etc, and other customisations.
